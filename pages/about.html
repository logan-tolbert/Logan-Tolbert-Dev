        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Logan, a dedicated full stack software developer from
          Birmingham, AL. My journey into tech started after a decade-long
          career as a mechanic. Though I had no prior experience in programming,
          I felt a strong desire to better myself and pursue a field that truly
          excited me.
        </p>

        <p>
          In January 2024, I took the leap and quit my job to focus on personal
          growth and explore the world of software development. I began with
          self-learning, diving into online courses and resources. While I
          initially experimented with HTML, CSS, JavaScript my curiosity for
          deeper programming led me to Python. Despite hitting a wall with
          Object-Oriented Programming concepts, I didn't give up.
        </p>

        <p>
          Determined to overcome my challenges, I joined a local bootcamp that
          taught C#. This experience has been transformative, and I've made
          considerable progress. I'm currently working on my final project for
          graduation, which has been a rewarding and eye-opening journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I may not have an extensive portfolio or decades of experience
          in tech, my diverse background and relentless drive to learn and grow
          are my biggest strengths. I've completed numerous mini-projects, each
          contributing to my understanding and skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find my playing guitar, listening to
          music, or gaming. I'm passionate about continuous learning and always
          eager to tackle new challenges and push the boundaries of what's
          possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting and
          exploring opportunities to collaborate!
